The RunTempo project aims to enhance running experience by matching song tempo to the runner's step cadence. Many studies show that the effects of music on running performance positively impacts exercise by elevating heart rate, improving endurance, and enhancing how the runner feels about the overall workout. In addition, it’s shown that the tempo of the music is able to affect a runner’s step cadence since runners frequently adjust their pace to match the music they listen to. The problem with existing programs is that the tempo range is too large, and the recommendation system is not dynamic. We seeked to build a solution that dynamically gave users songs in real time based on their running cadence by utilizing the Spotify API and data from the phone’s accelerometer. RunTempo dynamically adjusts the music to synchronize with the runner's pace, thereby improving motivation and performance.
This project was part of the altREU internship, and this is the iOS app portion of the project.
